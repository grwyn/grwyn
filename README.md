**Code** : [Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-projects/blob/main/Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction.ipynb)

**Description**: This project assists an airline in identifying areas for improvement based on feedback information from each client who utilized its services. The collection of data includes a wide range of information, including consumer gender, age, and type as well as numerous rating criteria like Inflight service and Cleanliness. It comprises 23 fields in total that are used to determine whether or not the customer is satisfied. My EDA was followed by various recommendations for successful problem-solving tactics. These suggestions intended to improve my strategy and were supported by data-driven insights. Then, in order to advise the person who required it, I utilized 10 different machine learning models to determine which one was the best and most effective.

**Goal**: To determine in which fields do the airline need improvement

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, predictive models, confusion matrix, balancing data.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Histplot, Correlation Heatmap, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, RobustScaler, ROC Curve, CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boost, K-Neighbors Classifier, GaussianNB, Multi-layer Perceptron

**Results**: Utilized various machine learning models to identify areas for improvement in an airline's services based on customer feedback, enhancing the airline's strategy and customer satisfaction
